## Installing the holoSim simulator

The holoSim simulator is written mostly in R with a few c++ routines used in an attempt to increase speed.  It can run on a laptop, though probably only as a demonstration or with small problems.

###To install on your machine (regardless of operating system):

*  Install a recent version of R (3.6.1 best) (https://cran.r-project.org/)
*  Install a recent version of an IDE (Rstudio most common: https://www.rstudio.com/)
*  Follow instructions for your OS below

####Windows 

This has been tested on windows 10, there may be problems with earlier versions

*  Install Rtools (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/Rtools35.exe).  Rtools is used for compiling c/c++/ and fortran-based packages (like holoSimCell)

####Mac
